# CS230 - Week 14: Counting Sort and Radix Sort

This project showcases radix sort by using counting sort as the core sorting algorithm.

## How to Run / Test

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/cfonbuena/cs230-w14.git
```

Go to the project directory

```

Run the compiled output
```bash
FOR WINDOWS:
  ./a.exe
  
FOR NON-WINDOWS:
  ./a.out
```


## Expected Output

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
TEST 1: Generated vector
Unsorted vector:
<array of 10 random values>
Sorted vector:
<sorted array of the random values in ascending order>

TEST 2: Provided vector
Unsorted vector:
321 123 919 414 555
Sorted vector:
123 321 414 555 919
```
